#Steps:
#1 Create a variable and set its initial value to the whole number '8'.
#2 Create a second variable and set its initial value to the whole number '10'.
#3 Assign the total of the first two integers to a third variable.
#4 Output the total sum value to the console.

#simple sums
#adding a number to the first variable
lady = (int(8))

#adding a number to the second variable
bug = (int(10))

#adding both the first and second variable to the third variable
jose = (lady + bug)

#print the variable moraino
print(jose)
